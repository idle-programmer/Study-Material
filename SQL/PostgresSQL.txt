*⁠What is Index/indexing?
->Index is a specialized data structure created on db columns to speed up data retrieval, 
and indexing is the technique of using these structures to improve query performance on db tables.


*⁠What is transaction in SQL?
->A SQL transaction groups one or more db operations (like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
into a single atomic unit that either fully succeeds (COMMIT) or fully fails (ROLLBACK).
syntax:
START TRANSACTION; -- or BEGIN 
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1; 
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 2; 
COMMIT; -- Save changes 
-- ROLLBACK; -- Undo if error


*Normalization
->Normalization reduces redundancy and improves data integrity by organizing data into proper tables.
1NF: Atomic values, no repeating groups.
2NF: 1NF + no partial dependencies (non-prime attributes depend on full key).
3NF: 2NF + no transitive dependencies.
Higher forms like BCNF handle edge cases.

*⁠What is LIKE operator -> LIKE operator matches text patterns in a column

*how do you optimise db query
->
Create indexes on frequently queried columns
Replace SELECT * with explicit column names to fetch only needed data
Use INNER JOINs over OUTER when possible
Apply WHERE filters, LIMIT, or pagination before aggregations/JOINs
Run EXPLAIN/EXPLAIN ANALYZE to inspect execution plans

*⁠What is aggregate?
->Aggregate functions in SQL perform calculations on a set of values 
COUNT(),SUM(),AVG(),MIN() and MAX()
​


*What is the datatype to store array ? -> Array
*What is the datatype to store json ? -> JSONB

*⁠ACID properties -> Set of rules that ensure reliable and consistent transactions in a database.
Atomicity: A transaction is all or nothing
Consistency: Transaction moves the database from one valid state to another
Isolation: Multiple transactions run independently
Durability: Once a transaction is committed, data is permanent


*How to optimize db with million data?
Strategic Indexing: Create composite indexes on frequently joined/filtered columns
Table Partitioning: Split large tables by date range, hash, or list.

*⁠How redis differ from MySQL?
->Redis is an in-memory NoSQL key-value store optimized for speed and caching, 
while MySQL is a disk-based relational SQL database designed for structured data and complex queries.



| Clause   | When it runs      | Used for            |
| -------- | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| `WHERE`  | Before `GROUP BY` | Row-level filtering |
| `HAVING` | After `GROUP BY`  | Aggregate filtering |
