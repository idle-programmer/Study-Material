What is JWT?
A JWT (JSON Web Token) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact, URL-safe way 
to securely transmit information between parties (usually client and server) as a JSON object. 
They are primarily used for authentication and authorization in web applications and APIs, allowing 
servers to verify user identities without keeping session data in memory. 




*Components of jwt token? (total 3 component)
-> Header: Token type (JWT), Algorithm (HS256, RS256)
Payload: UserID, Roles, Expiry, Issued time
Signature: secret_key

*How do you handle refresh token(RT)?
-> Access tokens are short-lived, and RT are long-lived. When access token expires, 
the client sends the RT to get a new access token. Blacklist RT on logout


How to secure JWT from vulnerablility?
-> 1.Short-lived access tokens
2. Use HTTPS always
3. Secure storage: HttpOnly + Secure cookies (preferred)
4. Strong signing algorithm: RS256
5. Add claims
exp → expiry
iat → issued at
aud, iss → validation
jti → unique token id
6. Token rotation: Refresh token changes every time
7. Blacklisting: Store revoked tokens in Redis

What will you do if ur JWT token gets compromised?
->If a JWT is compromised, I immediately revoke it using a blacklist, 
invalidate refresh tokens, force re-login, rotate keys if required, and monitor suspicious activity.

Any authentication mechanism other than JWT?
->OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, Session-based Auth, SSO, OTP
