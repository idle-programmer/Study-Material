*What does REST mean and what are RESTful Api?
-> Representational State Tansfer, its an architecture style to write api to communicate of F-End to B-End using HTTP.
Server is stateless.
REST principles: Resource-based, HTTP Methods, Stateless, Representation, Client–Server separation.
APIs that follow REST principles are RESTful Api

*⁠What is stateless & stateful api?
->Stateless-API: request is treated independent transaction, no inherent memory of previous requests.
Stateful-API: server maintain/retain info of client session/past interaction.

*⁠RESTful APIs are stateful or stateless? -> RESTful APIs must be stateless


*Put vs patch?
->PUT: Replaces entire resource
PATCH: Updates partial resource

If we can get data using POST, why do we use GET?
Even though POST can return data, GET is used because it is safe, cacheable, idempotent, 
and semantically correct for read-only operations, Get can be Bookmarked, Shared and Indexed by search engines.

If PUT can update data, why do we need PATCH?
PUT replaces the entire resource, while PATCH updates only specific fields, making 
PATCH safer and more efficient for partial updates.
