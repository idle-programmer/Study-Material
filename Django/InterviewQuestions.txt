*What does REST mean and what are RESTful Api?
-> Representational State Tansfer, its an architecture style to write api to communicate of F-End to B-End using HTTP.
Server is stateless.
REST principles: Resource-based, HTTP Methods, Stateless, Representation, Client–Server separation.
APIs that follow REST principles are RESTful Api

*⁠What is stateless & stateful api?
->Stateless-API: request is treated independent transaction, no inherent memory of previous requests.
Stateful-API: server maintain/retain info of client session/past interaction.

*⁠RESTful APIs are stateful or stateless? -> RESTful APIs must be stateless
*URLs in django-> mapping URLs to view functions/class
*Models in django-> structure and behavior of db tables
*⁠Views in django-> handle the business logic and data display
*⁠Django project architecture-> Model-View-Template 
*⁠ORM in django-> Pythonic way to interact with relational db without writing raw SQL code
*⁠How to obtain SQL query from queryset-> str(my_queryset.query)

*Put vs patch?
->PUT: Replaces entire resource
PATCH: Updates partial resource

*⁠How django determines whether migrations are already applied?
->recording each successful migration in a dedicated db table called django_migrations

*Q objects in Django?
-> Q objects let you build flexible filters by combining conditions with OR, AND, and NOT, 
so you can create more complex WHERE parts in the SQL queries that Django generates.

*Difference b/w Django vs Fast API vs Flask
->
Django: Full Web Framework includes admin, ORM, auth, template.Uses WSGI
FastAPI: API Framework,high-performance, async bydefault,used for microservice. Uses ASGI
Flask: Lightweight and flexible micro-framework.Uses WSGI

*⁠Which to use Django or Fast API?
->
Django: Business-heavy projects
FastAPI: High Performance or microservice architecture, High-traffic public APIs

*⁠What is CSRF?
->
Security Attact where a malicious site forces a logged-in user to perform 
unintended actions on a trustes site using their authenticated session
Example:
User logs into a trusted site (e.g. bank.com)
Session cookie is stored in the browser
User visits a malicious website
Malicious site sends a hidden request to bank.com
Browser automatically attaches cookies
Server thinks the request is genuine.

CSRF in Django: Django enables CSRF protection by default.(CsrfViewMiddleware)

*Where redis stores the data and what is redis port? -> RAM, 6379

*⁠How do you improve API response?
->
optimizing database queries: avoid N+1 query
caching: by redis
reducing payload size: by pagination
indexing: on foreign keys, filter/search fields
Async APIs
background tasks
Scaling infra: by multiple instance, loadbalancer

*How to secure api in django?
->
JWT / OAuth
DRF permissions
CSRF protection (for session auth)
Rate limiting (Redis)
HTTPS
Environment variables

*How do you handle complex queries in django?
->
Q objects for complex AND/OR/NOT logic
F expressions for field-to-field comparisons and in-database updates
annotate() and aggregate()
Subquery and OuterRef for nested queries
select_related() / prefetch_related()


*Have you faced memory leak issue and how did u solve?
-> Memory leaks can happen due to unclosed DB connections, infinite object references, or improper caching.
Tools & Fixes: tracemalloc, objgraph, psutil, Fix circular references, Use generators instead of loading big lists,
Close DB/file connections


*Difference between gunicon and uvicon?->
| Gunicorn         | Uvicorn                |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| WSGI server      | ASGI server            |
| Sync             | Async                  |
| Django           | FastAPI / Async Django |
| Slower for async | High performance       |


*Components of jwt token? (total 3 component)
-> Header: Token type (JWT), Algorithm (HS256, RS256)
Payload: UserID, Roles, Expiry, Issued time
Signature: secret_key

*How do you handle refresh token(RT)?
-> Access tokens are short-lived, and RT are long-lived. When access token expires, 
the client sends the RT to get a new access token. Blacklist RT on logout

*What is OAuth?
-> OAuth is an open authorization protocol that allows third-party apps to access 
user resources on a server without sharing credentials like passwords.(login by google, fb, etc)
django-oauth-toolkit

*⁠Explain select_related & prefetch_related?
-> select_related: one-to-one or foreign key, 
eg: Author has one Book via ForeignKey "Author.objects.select_related('book')"
prefetch_related: many-to-many or reverse foreign keys 
eg: Book has many Reviews via ForeignKey reverse "Book.objects.prefetch_related('reviews')"

*How to handle exception in django?
-> Using try-except blocks, Django middleware, and DRF global exception handlers.
